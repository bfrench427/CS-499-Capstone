# Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio
## CS-499 | SNHU

## Professional Self-Assessment
Over the duration of this course and throughout SNHU's Computer Science program, I have been building my skillset and knowledge. All in the hopes that I will use my acquired knowledge and skills to find a potential career in a Computer Science field of my choosing. This ePortfolio is meant to showcase a few of my completed works to potential employers, and that I am capable of producing industry-standard code for quality software. The artifacts chosen highlight different areas of Computer Science knowledge, including Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. These three categories will each have their own artifact and accompanying narrative explaining the process I used in order to enhance the artifact from its original form. 

Completing each of the the artifact enhancements shows my strengths in the aforementioned categories of Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. The artifact chosen for enhancment in both the Software Design and Database category was originally from the CS-465: Full Stack Development course. In this course, the task was to develop a web application using the MEAN stack. The acronym MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js. Each of these tools was utilized respectively to build the front and back end functions of the web application. This includes the user client page for a vacation booking website, and a client page for admin users to modify and maintain trip data used for the web page. In completing and enhancing this artifact, I have shown strength in developing software applications from front to back by establishing user interfaces for both clients, creating a RESTful API with proper routing methods, and establishing server connections to host the application. As mentioned, the artifact from CS-465: Full Stack Development also encapsulates the Database category of enhancment. This is because the MEAN stack incorporates MongoDB functionality to store relevant trip data for the client. One of the main issues with the original version of the artifact was that it did not correctly establish connections with the MongoDB database. After enhancement, the artifact now includes the option to view trip data from the admin client user interface with the option to add and edit entries. This enhancement overall showcases my strengths in working with document-based databases, such as the MongoDB database used in the artifact, and creating effective user interfaces for easy data manipulation. The final category to mentions is Algorithms and Data Structures. For this category, I selected the artifact from CS-370: Current & Emerging Trends. In this course, the task was to develop a reinforcement learning algorithm that an intelligent agent could solve a maze game. The reinforcement learning algorithm was developed as with Deep Q-learning, which is a model-free algorithm. This means that the intelligent agent was tested with zero prior knowledge of the maze structure or the rules of the game. After completing the original artifact, the agent was able to solve the maze after about 46 minutes of play time. For the enhancement, my goal was to improve upon the intelligent agent's learning speed so that it would complete the maze quicker. After completing this enhancement, I have shown strength in areas of hyperparamater manipulation and optimization, improve algorithm efficiency, and implementation of model-free learning algorithms. Besides the artifacts included in this ePortfolio, other examples that highlight areas of strength are from CS-320: Software Test & Automation QA and CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle. The CS-320 course artifact required test cases be built against the project's code in order to test the security and logic of the program. Highlighting strength in coding secure methods with efficiency that function as intended. And the the CS-250 course artifact is a sprint review document highlighting the Scrum-Agile approach to project development. Conduction of a sprint review shows strength in understanding of Scrum-Agile team roles and their contributions, customer collaboration, effective communication, and how to adapt to changing requirements during project development.
### Collaborating in a Team Environment
Within the CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle course, each student was assigned a group to simulate the process of working within a Scrum-Agile team environment. Each student chose a role and discussed which agile principles we wished to add to our team's personal methodology to benefit our respective roles and the team as a whole. We also shared ideas on different project management tools our team could invest in to schedule tasks, track progress, and set deadlines. Thanks to this course and the experience it provided, I have learned how an Agile team works through project development, communicates with one another, and how each role collaborates to ensure project goals are met.
### Communicating with Stakeholders
Also within the CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle course, one of the module's assignments was to assume the role of the Product Owner within the Scrum-Agile team. As the Product Onwer, I reviewed feedback from a focus group of stakeholders invested in the development of the team's current project. From that feedback, I constructed user stories that would be used to form the requirments of the project. From this experience, I was able to learn how to effectively translate feedback from communicating with stakeholders into tangible requirements that a project should meet. That way, a software project can begin development with an understanding of its goals and how to best satisfy stakeholder expectations.
### Data Structures and Algorithms
The artifact from CS-370: Current & Emerging Trends is a reinforcement learning algorithm used to train an intelligent agent to solve a maze game. The algorithm used to instruct the agent is a model-free Deep Q-learning algorithm that switches between exploration and exploitaiton through a learning rate decay function. Developing this artifact helped me improve upon my ability to design algorithmic solutions to solve computing problems while also managing the differnet hyperparamters to increase the algorithm's learning efficiency.
### Software Engineering and Database
The artifact from CS-465: Full Stack Development is a fullstack web application built from front to the back end using the MEAN stack. The main focus of enhancing this artifact was to update the admin client SPA (single page application), as it previously did not function due to logic inconsistencies in the guide used for development. After enhancement, the SPA now fulfills its original function of enabling CRUD methods to manipulate trip data stored in a MongoDB database. Therefore, I have demonstrated that I am able to incorporate different software tools (the MEAN stack) and the skills required to achieve compatability between said tools to engineer the computing solutions in both front and back end development. I also have shown that I am capable of developing user friendly communications through the usage of simple user interfaces that can modify databases.
### Security
During the CS-305: Software Security course, I was tasked with conducting vulnerability assessments on an artifact to determine where in the software different security risks existed. After conducting the vulnerability assessments, each one needed to be documented with its CVE code, which package was affected, the version of the package in question, and any current fixes available by checking the common vulnerabilities database. As such, I have experience in assessing the security of a program through its potential vulnerabilities, conducting vulnerability assessments within code, and taking measures to mitigate vulnerabilities to enhance security.
